This is a small collection of script and inputs to investigate how the kaon decay-at-rest KDAR measurement from the JSNS^2 collaboration (https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01383) could be used to improve T2K cross section models of the nuclear ground state. 
The plots are made using 
```
python makeplots.py
```

and the files can be edited inside the script, at the bottom. 

The plots will be saved in the `plots` folder.
